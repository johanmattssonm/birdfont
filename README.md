packages with a -dev or -devel affix:

    valac
    python3-doit
    libxmlbird-dev
    libgee-0.8-dev
    libglib2.0-dev 
    libgtk-3-dev 
    libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev

XML Bird is available from [birdfont.org][xmlbird].

BirdFont have two build systems, one python script that builds all
binaries at once and one dependency based build system that uses
doit.

Configure, build and install with python:

    ./configure
    ./build.py
    sudo ./install.py

The default prefix is /usr/local. On some system is /usr the right prefix.

    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    ./build.py
     sudo ./install.py

All patches must be compiled with support for valas null pointer checks.
Configure the project with ./configure --nonnull
